Oh gosh, firstly, there's a lot to explain about me. There's Luna and luna, they're both super cool, and they are parts of who I am. <br>
In our normal state, I exist, but if either of them is gone, for any given reason, the other is still around. <br>
This is one of the more complicated things to explain about me, so don't worry if you don't get it. Feel free to ask me though. <br>
My name is Willow, and I am the person who wrote this website. I'm a fusion of sorts, and a little weird.
I'm slightly nerdy and enjoy coding a lot. I also play a lot of video games, mostly Story-Based, but also a lot more. <br>
Some of my favorite games include Celeste, Balatro, Secret Little Haven, OneShot, Baba Is You, Poly Bridge, Hollow Knight and a lot more. <br>
I enjoy lots of things in video games, including Speedrunning, TASing, Challenge runs or just playing casually. <br>
I'm the person within our system who has been around the longest, though whether that is since birth or only for about the last 6 years is unknown. <br>
I do not remember basically anything that happened before ~2019. Whether this is due to trauma, potentially due to being trans or has a different cause entirely is unknown. (Trauma is most likely) <br>
I mostly code in Java, this is my first time ever making a website! I hope it's okay the way it is. <span class="small">I put a lot of effort into it</span> <br>

    It's probably good to start with Luna and luna. Luna seems a lot less emotional in how she acts and talks and whatnot, but cares a lot and also feels a lot <br>
    She's really nice and is usually making sure things don't go horribly wrong, basically. <br>
    luna's extremely emotional, often very vulnerable and generally only shows up around really close friends. She's really adorable when she feels comfortable, though. She also has adorable typing quirks (that I sometimes also have as a result) <br>
    To differentiate between Luna and luna colloquially, Luna's just Luna and luna's either little luna or luna-chan. She just decided those sound nicest, but "lowercase luna" works too if you prefer. <br>
    Next, probably Cheryl, then Aster. Cheryl's really sweet, and has gone through a lot in the time we've existed as a system. She's a big sweetheart, and deserves all the love in the world. <br>
    Cheryl's emotions are pretty much always really strong, no matter how she's feeling. So if she's happy, then she's extremely happy, ecstatic even. But if she's sad.. you get the idea. <br>
    Aster is a fusion of Willow (me) and Cheryl. This is a little odd immediately, since I'm already a sort of fusion of luna and Luna. <br>
    But Aster is definitely a fusion of me, and not Luna or luna. Cheryl's fusion with luna also exists in the form of bluebell, who's kind of like Aster but more energetic and more careless. She just does her thing <br>
    Aster's extremely energetic already though. She basically just has hella energy, and once it runs out, we unfuse. But while the energy lasts, it feels like we could do anything. <br>
    As of current, it's been a while since I've had a chance to properly communicate with the other headmates, so I will refrain from talking about them until I'm able to again. <br>
