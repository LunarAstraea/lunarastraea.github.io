        Cheryl (she/her) - Waiting for her to write this herself. She's really sweet. <br>
        Glade (?/?) - Waiting for Glade to write this. Cares a lot more than it seems. <br>
        Jay (any/all) - Waiting for him to write this themselves. Has been around very little recently. <br>
        Caelie (she/?) - Waiting for her to write this. Is either very sweet or very sassy, cannot tell. <br>
        Aster (she/they) - Temporary fusion of Luna and Cheryl. Extra silly, extra awesome, extra energy. <br>

            <p class="mainpink">
                If you are confused about who wrote something here, simply hover over it to see their name. <br>
                <span class="hoverbox">I cannot speak for everyone else, so I will start with information about myself: <br>
                My name is Luna, I am the person who wrote this website. I'm slightly nerdy and enjoy coding a lot. I also play a lot of video games, mostly Story-Based, but also a lot more. <br>
                Some of my favorite games include Celeste, Balatro, Secret Little Haven, OneShot, Baba Is You, Poly Bridge, Hollow Knight and a lot more. <br>
                I'm the person within our system who has been around the longest, though whether that is since birth or only for about the last 6 years is unknown. <br>
                I do not remember basically anything that happened before ~2019. Whether this is due to trauma, potentially due to being trans or has a different cause entirely is unknown. <br>
                I mostly code in Java, this is my first time ever making a website! I hope it's okay the way it is. <span class="small">I put a lot of effort into it</span> <br>
                Once my headmates have time, hopefully they'll write something about themselves here.
