        <span class="hoverbox">I cannot speak for everyone else, so I will start with information about myself: <br>
            My name is Luna, I am the person who wrote this website. I'm slightly nerdy and enjoy coding a lot. I also play a lot of video games. <br>
            I'm the person within our system, who has been around the longest, though whether that is since birth or only for about the last 6 years is unknown. <br>
            I mostly code in Java, this is my first time ever making a website! I hope it's okay the way it is.
            This is all I had time to make for now. More should be coming soonâ„¢
